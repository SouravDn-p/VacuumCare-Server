# Technician role and job flow

The technician is a **field worker**. They do not quote, schedule, take payment, or
pick jobs from a pool. Admin assigns them after the customer accepts the quote and
authorizes the Stripe hold. The technician then runs the visit, records equipment,
uploads photos, and submits the service report. The office reviews the report and
captures payment. The customer confirms the work.

Figma source (mobile Technician App on the **customer & Technician App** page):
[aryegrunzweig || Code tribe](https://www.figma.com/design/iefawp5uBuQ8EfPxfCmGs2/aryegrunzweig-%7C%7C-Code-tribe?node-id=0-1).

The web app already ships the **customer storefront** and **admin dashboard**.
The Figma technician screens are a **mobile app**. Every screen there is already
backed by existing APIs. Do not add a second schedule, quote, or assign API.

All routes use the global `/api` prefix. Technician calls need:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

The JWT `role` must be `TECHNICIAN`. Routes under `/technician/*` also use
`TechnicianGuard` and reject any other role.

Base URL in the examples: `http://localhost:5000`.

## What a technician is allowed to do

| Work | Technician |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Register and verify email | Yes — `POST /auth/technician/signup`, then OTP |
| Sign in / reset password | Yes — same login and OTP reset as other roles |
| See only **assigned** jobs | Yes — list is filtered by `technicianId = me` |
| Start a scheduled visit | Yes — `SCHEDULED` → `IN_PROGRESS` |
| Call or message the customer | Yes — Agora call + request conversation |
| Share live location while travelling or on site | Yes — only for `SCHEDULED` / `IN_PROGRESS` jobs they own |
| Upload before / after / equipment / inlet media | Yes |
| Record unit and inlet counts | Yes |
| Submit or update the service report | Yes — while `IN_PROGRESS` or `REPORT_SUBMITTED` |
| Edit own profile, availability, notification prefs | Yes |
| Create quotes, assign jobs, or set the appointment | **No** — admin only |
| Cancel a customer request | **No** |
| Capture or refund Stripe | **No** — admin after the customer confirms the report |

Admin still owns: review new requests, send quotes, decide counteroffers, assign
`POST /admin/service-requests/:id/assign`, calendar `GET /admin/schedule`, and
payment capture.

```text

Customer confirms     POST /service-requests/:id/report/customer-confirm
Admin captures        POST /admin/payments/:id/capture          → COMPLETED
```

## Status machine the technician UI should render

| Request `status` | Technician screen |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| anything before `SCHEDULED` | Hidden — not assigned yet |
| `SCHEDULED` | Upcoming job. Actions: view details, call, directions, **Mark as in progress**, share location |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | Open job. Upload photos, notes, equipment, **Complete service report** |
| `REPORT_SUBMITTED` | Report is with the office. Technician may still update the report |
| `COMPLETED` | Done — show in Completed |
| `CANCELLED` | Do not start or report |

Home KPI cards in Figma (jobs today, in progress, completed this month, average
rating) are **not** a separate endpoint. Count them from
`GET /technician/service-requests` plus `GET /users/me` (`technician.rating`).

My Jobs tabs:

| Tab | How to build it |
| --- | --------------- |
| Today | Assigned jobs whose `scheduledStart` falls on the device local day |
| Upcoming | `SCHEDULED` (and future `IN_PROGRESS` if you want “still open”) |
| Completed | `COMPLETED` (optionally `REPORT_SUBMITTED`) |

`GET /technician/service-requests?status=` filters one enum value. Combine
client-side for Today vs Upcoming.

## Figma screens → APIs

Checked against the Technician App frames on the Figma page above.

| Figma screen | Already implemented |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Login / Create account / Forgot password | `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/technician/signup`, password-reset OTP |
| Home — greeting, jobs today, in progress, completed, rating, today’s job cards | `GET /users/me`, `GET /technician/service-requests` |
| Open Job / View details | `GET /technician/service-requests/:id` |
| Call customer | `POST /calls/service-request/:id/token` (or native `tel:` from `customer.phone`) |
| Get directions | Client maps using `address` on the request — no maps API in this backend |
| Mark as in progress | `PATCH /technician/service-requests/:id/status` |
| Upload before / after photos | `POST /technician/service-requests/:id/media` `kind=BEFORE` / `AFTER` |
| Add technician notes | `POST /technician/service-requests/:id/report` `technicianNotes` |
| Open equipment & inlet details | `POST /technician/service-requests/:id/equipment` |
| Complete / submit service report | `POST /technician/service-requests/:id/report` |
| Job photos: Before, After, Equip., Inlet | media `kind` `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `EQUIPMENT`, `INLET` |
| My Jobs (Today / Upcoming / Completed) | list + client date/status filters |
| Notifications / Alerts | `GET /notifications`, SSE stream |
| Chat | `GET /conversations`, send on `/conversations/:id/messages` |
| Profile, edit, service area, logout | `GET/PATCH /users/me`, `PATCH /users/me/technician`, `POST /auth/logout` |
| Live tracking (customer sees ETA) | technician `POST /tracking/service-requests/:id/location` |

Client-only (no extra backend):

- **Get directions** — open Apple/Google Maps from the job address.
- **Previous visit** on the job card — not a dedicated field. Derive from earlier
  completed requests for the same customer if the app needs it.
- **Home KPI totals** — count on the client from the assigned-job list.

## 1. Register and sign in

Technicians register with service area and skills. The account stays inactive until
the 5-digit email OTP is verified. Admin then verifies the technician profile
(`PENDING_VERIFICATION` → `VERIFIED`) before they can be assigned to jobs.

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/technician/signup' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "marc@centralcare.ca",
    "password": "secure-password",
    "firstName": "Marc",
    "lastName": "Anderson",
    "phone": "+1 514 555 0100",
    "acceptTerms": true,
    "serviceArea": "Greater Montréal",
    "skills": ["Central vacuum repair", "Installation"]
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "email": "marc@centralcare.ca",
    "password": "secure-password"
  }'
```

`user.role` in the login payload is `TECHNICIAN`. Send that access token on every
call below.

---

## 2. Home and my jobs

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/users/me' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests?status=SCHEDULED' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'
```

The list is **only jobs assigned to this technician**. Unassigned accepted
requests never appear here — those belong on the admin calendar / technicians
Assign Job modal.

Each item includes customer, address, category, issue, description, schedule
window, status, media, and report when present.

---

## 3. Open a job

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests/clxreq01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'
```

`403` if the job is not assigned to this technician.

Use this payload for Customer Details, Service Details, and Customer-Reported
Issue (including customer `ISSUE` media).

---

## 4. Start the visit

Only the assigned technician, and only from `SCHEDULED`:

```bash
curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests/clxreq01/status' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS"
  }'
```

`200` — `status` becomes `IN_PROGRESS`, `startedAt` is set. After this the
customer can no longer cancel.

While `SCHEDULED` or `IN_PROGRESS`, publish GPS so the customer tracking screen
can poll:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/tracking/service-requests/clxreq01/location' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "latitude": 45.5017,
    "longitude": -73.5673
  }'
```

Call the customer (Agora). Customer, assigned technician, or admin may join:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/calls/service-request/clxreq01/token' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'
```

---

## 5. Media, equipment, and report

Figma “Technician Actions” map 1:1 to these writes.

**Photos / videos** (multipart `file` or hosted `url`):

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests/clxreq01/media' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -F 'kind=BEFORE' \
  -F 'file=@before.jpg'
```

`kind` for technicians: `BEFORE`, `AFTER`, `EQUIPMENT`, `INLET`.
`ISSUE` media is customer-only.

**Equipment and vacuum ports:**

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests/clxreq01/equipment' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "unitNumber": "Unit 24",
    "manufacturer": "Cyclo Vac",
    "model": "H725",
    "serialNumber": "SN-123456",
    "location": "Utility room",
    "condition": "Good",
    "inlets": [
      { "floor": "Basement", "type": "Standard inlet", "quantity": 3 }
    ]
  }'
```

Same `unitNumber` on the same request updates the existing row.

**Service report** (Figma: work performed, parts used, technician notes, visit
times, submit for office review):

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/technician/service-requests/clxreq01/report' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "repairStatus": "Repaired",
    "workPerformed": "Removed a blockage from the basement branch line and tested suction at all accessible inlets.",
    "technicianNotes": "One older inlet valve on the first floor may need replacement on a future visit.",
    "partsUsed": [
      { "name": "Replacement inlet valve", "quantity": 1 },
      { "name": "PVC coupling", "quantity": 1 }
    ],
    "followUpRequired": false,
    "arrivalTime": "2026-08-01T13:05:00.000Z",
    "departureTime": "2026-08-01T14:35:00.000Z"
  }'
```

Allowed when status is `IN_PROGRESS` or `REPORT_SUBMITTED` (resubmit / edit).
First submit moves the request to `REPORT_SUBMITTED` and notifies the customer
and admins. The office then captures payment; the technician does not mark
`COMPLETED`.

---

## 6. Chat, alerts, and profile

```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/conversations' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'

curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/notifications' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>'

curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:5000/api/users/me' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "firstName": "Marc", "phone": "+1 514 555 0100" }'

curl -X PATCH 'http://localhost:5000/api/users/me/technician' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <technicianAccessToken>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "serviceArea": "Greater Montréal",
    "isAvailable": true
  }'
```

`PATCH /users/me/technician` is technician-only. Admin assignment requires
`isAvailable: true` and `verificationStatus: VERIFIED`.

Conversations are created when admin assigns the job. The technician lists
threads where `technicianId` is themselves.

---

## Who does what on one request

```text
Customer          submit request → accept quote → authorize card → confirm report
Admin             review → quote → assign technician + time → capture payment
Technician        start job → photos / equipment / notes → submit report
```

The technician never sets `scheduledStart`. A time change is an admin re-assign.
See [schedule.md](../schedule/schedule.md).
